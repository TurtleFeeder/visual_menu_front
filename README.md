# visual_menu_front

This is a visual menu application to display the restaurant's menu items. The current version of this application allows a user to view a restaurant's menu by clicking on the restaurant's name on the side navigation. The restaurant's information then appears on the top of the main section of the page and the menu items of the selected restaurant are below it. The user can then mouse over the specific menu item they'd like to see and the menu's image and details are shown to the right of the menu list. Within the menu details section there is a section to see the reviews of the selected menu item.
